# Simple https server with websockets.

A simple introduction to node.js with https server and websockets.

This project demonstrates some good habits (in my opinion) for NodeJS devs.

By using small code files and DI unit tests become easier, the scope gets smaller and each function has it sole purpose.

Remember that JS is a functional programming language, this code demonstrates that by avoiding prototypes and this keyword. It also shows a smiple way of creating a JS class.
